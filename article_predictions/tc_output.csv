“Should I stay at home and not come to Kenya and learn about farming and malaria?” Gates said in the interview with Amol Rajan.

“I’m comfortable with the idea that not only am I not part of the problem by paying for the offsets, but also through the billions that my Breakthrough Energy Group is spending, that I’m part of the solution,” Gates added. Watch:

Earlier this year, Gates flew around Australia on board his $70 million dollar luxury private jet lecturing people about climate change and ordering them to stop flying on planes.

Gates, who has declared that the energy crisis is a good thing, owns no fewer than FOUR private jets at a combined cost of $194 million dollars.

A study carried out by Linnaeus University economics professor Stefan Gössling found that Gates flew more than 213,000 miles on 59 private jet flights in 2017 alone.

Gates emitted an estimated 1,760 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, over a hundred times more than the emissions per capita in the United States, according to data from the World Bank.

Elsewhere during the carefully constructed interview, Gates said he was surprised that he was targeted by ‘conspiracy theorists’ for pushing vaccines during the pandemic.

Gates claimed that because he continues to “spend billions of dollars” on climate change activism, his carbon footprint isn’t an issue.

 Russia threatens nukes for US, UK, Finland if NATO expands

Vladimir Putin warned the president of Finland Saturday that any effort to join NATO would “negatively” affect relations between the two countries.

The comments followed another Russian leader’s threat to use the Satan-2 hypersonic nuclear missile to strike Britain and Finland “in just 200 seconds” — and that the weapons could be used to hit the United States as well.

As NATO foreign ministers gathered in Berlin, with discussion about potential applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western military alliance on the agenda, Putin spoke to Finnish leader Sauli Niinisto.

Nijnisto told Putin in the phone conversation that the traditionally non-aligned country “will decide to apply for NATO membership in the coming days.”

Finland and Sweden, also traditionally neutral, are moving toward the applications in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In response, Russia cut off electricity supplies to Finland on Friday.

Putin told Niinisto that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security,” the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.”

Niinisto’s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

The exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.

“If Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate — to question the existence of this state. This is logical,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, 59, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense committee, said in an interview with The Mirror. “The Finns in general should be grateful to Russia for their statehood, for the fact that Finland exists as a country.”

“If the United States threatens our state, it’s good: here is the Sarmat [Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist,” he continued. “And Finland says that it is at one with the USA. Well, get in line.”

The Satan-2 is a ballistic missile capable of carrying 10 to 15 nuclear warheads, with an estimated destructive power of three megatons each.

Russia wouldn’t need to move nukes to its European border to carry out its threat, officials boasted.

“We can hit with a Sarmat [known in the West as Satan-2] from Siberia, and even reach the UK,” he said. “And if we strike from Kaliningrad … the hypersonic’s reaching time is 200 seconds – so go ahead, guys.

“On the Finnish border we will have not strategic weapons, but Kinzhal-class, one that will reach Finland in 20 seconds, or even 10 seconds.”

Putin told Niinisto that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security,” the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.”

Niinisto’s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

The exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.

“If Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate — to question the existence of this state. This is logical,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, 59, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense committee, said in an interview with The Mirror. “The Finns in general should be grateful to Russia for their statehood, for the fact that Finland exists as a country.”

“If the United States threatens our state, it’s good: here is the Sarmat [Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist,” he continued. “And Finland says that it is at one with the USA. Well, get in line.”

The Satan-2 is a ballistic missile capable of carrying 10 to 15 nuclear warheads, with an estimated destructive power of three megatons each.

Russia wouldn’t need to move nukes to its European border to carry out its threat, officials boasted.

“We can hit with a Sarmat [known in the West as Satan-2] from Siberia, and even reach the UK,” he said. “And if we strike from Kaliningrad … the hypersonic’s reaching time is 200 seconds – so go ahead, guys.

“On the Finnish border we will have not strategic weapons, but Kinzhal-class, one that will reach Finland in 20 seconds, or even 10 seconds.”

 Russia threatens nukes for US, UK, Finland if NATO expands

Vladimir Putin warned the president of Finland Saturday that any effort to join NATO would “negatively” affect relations between the two countries.

The comments followed another Russian leader’s threat to use the Satan-2 hypersonic nuclear missile to strike Britain and Finland “in just 200 seconds” — and that the weapons could be used to hit the United States as well.

As NATO foreign ministers gathered in Berlin, with discussion about potential applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western military alliance on the agenda, Putin spoke to Finnish leader Sauli Niinisto.

Nijnisto told Putin in the phone conversation that the traditionally non-aligned country “will decide to apply for NATO membership in the coming days.”

Finland and Sweden, also traditionally neutral, are moving toward the applications in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In response, Russia cut off electricity supplies to Finland on Friday.

Putin told Niinisto that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security,” the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.”

Niinisto’s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

The exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.

“If Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate — to question the existence of this state. This is logical,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, 59, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense committee, said in an interview with The Mirror. “The Finns in general should be grateful to Russia for their statehood, for the fact that Finland exists as a country.”

“If the United States threatens our state, it’s good: here is the Sarmat [Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist,” he continued. “And Finland says that it is at one with the USA. Well, get in line.”

The Satan-2 is a ballistic missile capable of carrying 10 to 15 nuclear warheads, with an estimated destructive power of three megatons each.

Russia wouldn’t need to move nukes to its European border to carry out its threat, officials boasted.

As NATO foreign ministers gathered in Berlin, with discussion about potential applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western military alliance on the agenda, Putin spoke to Finnish leader Sauli Niinisto.

Nijnisto told Putin in the phone conversation that the traditionally non-aligned country “will decide to apply for NATO membership in the coming days.”

Finland and Sweden, also traditionally neutral, are moving toward the applications in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In response, Russia cut off electricity supplies to Finland on Friday.

Putin told Niinisto that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security,” the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.”

Niinisto’s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

The exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.

“If Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate — to question the existence of this state. This is logical,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, 59, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense committee, said in an interview with The Mirror. “The Finns in general should be grateful to Russia for their statehood, for the fact that Finland exists as a country.”

“If the United States threatens our state, it’s good: here is the Sarmat [Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist,” he continued. “And Finland says that it is at one with the USA. Well, get in line.”

The Satan-2 is a ballistic missile capable of carrying 10 to 15 nuclear warheads, with an estimated destructive power of three megatons each.

Russia wouldn’t need to move nukes to its European border to carry out its threat, officials boasted.

“We can hit with a Sarmat [known in the West as Satan-2] from Siberia, and even reach the UK,” he said. “And if we strike from Kaliningrad … the hypersonic’s reaching time is 200 seconds – so go ahead, guys.

“On the Finnish border we will have not strategic weapons, but Kinzhal-class, one that will reach Finland in 20 seconds, or even 10 seconds.”

 Russia threatens nukes for US, UK, Finland if NATO expands

Vladimir Putin warned the president of Finland Saturday that any effort to join NATO would “negatively” affect relations between the two countries.

The comments followed another Russian leader’s threat to use the Satan-2 hypersonic nuclear missile to strike Britain and Finland “in just 200 seconds” — and that the weapons could be used to hit the United States as well.

As NATO foreign ministers gathered in Berlin, with discussion about potential applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western military alliance on the agenda, Putin spoke to Finnish leader Sauli Niinisto.

Nijnisto told Putin in the phone conversation that the traditionally non-aligned country “will decide to apply for NATO membership in the coming days.”

Finland and Sweden, also traditionally neutral, are moving toward the applications in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In response, Russia cut off electricity supplies to Finland on Friday.

Putin told Niinisto that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security,” the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.”

Niinisto’s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

The exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.

 Letters to the Editor: How the U.S. can fight in Ukraine without leading to nuclear war

To the editor: I read the letters to the editor, and there is a clear divide between those who think the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should confront the aggressor, or whether that’s too likely to cause an escalation in the war.

While many people draw parallels between Hitler and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, there is one very clear difference: Putin has nukes.

Nevertheless, while nuclear annihilation is a risk of escalation, appeasement of war criminals has never tamed them. If Putin is allowed to “take” Ukraine, what is to convince him, then, that “taking” Poland is not equally attainable?

At this point, I don’t like any of the alternatives. I think limited, conventional warfare is in order, utilizing lots of conventional high-tech weaponry. The war should not be escalated beyond that, even if Russia uses chemical or biological weapons.

If the Kraken is already released, what choice do we have but to confront it?

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is horrific and needs to be addressed forcefully by the U.S. and its allies. But why should the U.S. and NATO engage in armed conflict in the latest global tragedy while ignoring or being responsible for much larger humanitarian disasters of the past few decades, which resulted in much higher fatalities?

Like the invasion of Ukraine, these humanitarian disasters unleashed unthinkable death and destruction on innocent people. Unlike the invasion of Ukraine, they took place in nonwhite and non-European locations.

 Putin Says West Prepared To Scapegoat Zelensky For War Failures: 'Replaced By Next Year'

Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Vietnam, where he signed at least a dozen energy and trade deals with the country's President To Lam, on his tour to shore up ties in Asia in an effort to offset the West's drive to isolate Moscow.

On his last day in the country he made some wide-ranging remarks to the press, and among the most interesting was a statement on the future of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Putin predicted at a moment things are going very badly for Ukrainian forces, and at a rare time Western media seems to be turning on Zelensky, that the Ukrainian leader will soon be replaced over his poor and unpopular decision-making. Putin suggested Washington is essentially going to make him a scapegoat.

""In the West, they simply do not want to replace him [Zelenskyy], the time is not right. I think it's obvious to anyone. They will blame all unpopular decisions on him, including lowering the [military] draft age, and that's it,"" Putin asserted, according to Russian media translation.

That's when he followed with: ""And then they'll replace him. I think it will happen sometime in the first half of next year.""

Putin could be at least in part seizing on the obvious increased negative coverage of the Zelensky government in major Western media outlets, from the BBC to NY Times to Wall Street Journal. Indeed Zelensky's 'celebrity power' on display throughout the first part of the war, where it seemed he could simply do no wrong in the media's eyes, is waning fast.

More importantly, there are signs of large-scale dissent among the Ukrainian population as recruitment officers violently grab men from off the streets.

Despite Kiev forces clearly being against the ropes of late, Zelensky has still refused to even contemplate negotiating. He has stood by his earlier commitment to not enter dialogue toward ceasefire until Putin is out of power. Putin commented on this while in Vietnam:

Talks on Ukraine could take place as early as tomorrow, but Russia will use the current situation as a starting point, the president added.

""We have been conducting these behind-the-scenes talks, and what we hoped for has failed,"" Putin told reporters.

Zelensky's advisor, Alexey Arestovich, argued in 2019:— Glenn Diesen (@Glenn_Diesen) April 9, 2024

- ""Our price for joining NATO is a big war with Russia""

 Putin Says West Prepared To Scapegoat Zelensky For War Failures: 'Replaced By Next Year'

Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Vietnam, where he signed at least a dozen energy and trade deals with the country's President To Lam, on his tour to shore up ties in Asia in an effort to offset the West's drive to isolate Moscow.

On his last day in the country he made some wide-ranging remarks to the press, and among the most interesting was a statement on the future of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Putin predicted at a moment things are going very badly for Ukrainian forces, and at a rare time Western media seems to be turning on Zelensky, that the Ukrainian leader will soon be replaced over his poor and unpopular decision-making. Putin suggested Washington is essentially going to make him a scapegoat.

""In the West, they simply do not want to replace him [Zelenskyy], the time is not right. I think it's obvious to anyone. They will blame all unpopular decisions on him, including lowering the [military] draft age, and that's it,"" Putin asserted, according to Russian media translation.

That's when he followed with: ""And then they'll replace him. I think it will happen sometime in the first half of next year.""

Putin could be at least in part seizing on the obvious increased negative coverage of the Zelensky government in major Western media outlets, from the BBC to NY Times to Wall Street Journal. Indeed Zelensky's 'celebrity power' on display throughout the first part of the war, where it seemed he could simply do no wrong in the media's eyes, is waning fast.

More importantly, there are signs of large-scale dissent among the Ukrainian population as recruitment officers violently grab men from off the streets.

Despite Kiev forces clearly being against the ropes of late, Zelensky has still refused to even contemplate negotiating. He has stood by his earlier commitment to not enter dialogue toward ceasefire until Putin is out of power. Putin commented on this while in Vietnam:

Talks on Ukraine could take place as early as tomorrow, but Russia will use the current situation as a starting point, the president added.

""We have been conducting these behind-the-scenes talks, and what we hoped for has failed,"" Putin told reporters.

Putin suggested Washington is essentially going to make him a scapegoat.

""In the West, they simply do not want to replace him [Zelenskyy], the time is not right. I think it's obvious to anyone. They will blame all unpopular decisions on him, including lowering the [military] draft age, and that's it,"" Putin asserted, according to Russian media translation.

That's when he followed with: ""And then they'll replace him. I think it will happen sometime in the first half of next year.""

Putin could be at least in part seizing on the obvious increased negative coverage of the Zelensky government in major Western media outlets, from the BBC to NY Times to Wall Street Journal. Indeed Zelensky's 'celebrity power' on display throughout the first part of the war, where it seemed he could simply do no wrong in the media's eyes, is waning fast.

More importantly, there are signs of large-scale dissent among the Ukrainian population as recruitment officers violently grab men from off the streets.

Despite Kiev forces clearly being against the ropes of late, Zelensky has still refused to even contemplate negotiating. He has stood by his earlier commitment to not enter dialogue toward ceasefire until Putin is out of power. Putin commented on this while in Vietnam:

Talks on Ukraine could take place as early as tomorrow, but Russia will use the current situation as a starting point, the president added.

""We have been conducting these behind-the-scenes talks, and what we hoped for has failed,"" Putin told reporters.

 Putin Says West Prepared To Scapegoat Zelensky For War Failures: 'Replaced By Next Year'

Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Vietnam, where he signed at least a dozen energy and trade deals with the country's President To Lam, on his tour to shore up ties in Asia in an effort to offset the West's drive to isolate Moscow.

On his last day in the country he made some wide-ranging remarks to the press, and among the most interesting was a statement on the future of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Putin predicted at a moment things are going very badly for Ukrainian forces, and at a rare time Western media seems to be turning on Zelensky, that the Ukrainian leader will soon be replaced over his poor and unpopular decision-making. Putin suggested Washington is essentially going to make him a scapegoat.

""In the West, they simply do not want to replace him [Zelenskyy], the time is not right. I think it's obvious to anyone. They will blame all unpopular decisions on him, including lowering the [military] draft age, and that's it,"" Putin asserted, according to Russian media translation.

That's when he followed with: ""And then they'll replace him. I think it will happen sometime in the first half of next year.""

More importantly, there are signs of large-scale dissent among the Ukrainian population as recruitment officers violently grab men from off the streets.

Despite Kiev forces clearly being against the ropes of late, Zelensky has still refused to even contemplate negotiating. He has stood by his earlier commitment to not enter dialogue toward ceasefire until Putin is out of power. Putin commented on this while in Vietnam:

Talks on Ukraine could take place as early as tomorrow, but Russia will use the current situation as a starting point, the president added.

""We have been conducting these behind-the-scenes talks, and what we hoped for has failed,"" Putin told reporters.

That's when he followed with: ""And then they'll replace him. I think it will happen sometime in the first half of next year.""

Putin could be at least in part seizing on the obvious increased negative coverage of the Zelensky government in major Western media outlets, from the BBC to NY Times to Wall Street Journal. Indeed Zelensky's 'celebrity power' on display throughout the first part of the war, where it seemed he could simply do no wrong in the media's eyes, is waning fast.

More importantly, there are signs of large-scale dissent among the Ukrainian population as recruitment officers violently grab men from off the streets.

Despite Kiev forces clearly being against the ropes of late, Zelensky has still refused to even contemplate negotiating. He has stood by his earlier commitment to not enter dialogue toward ceasefire until Putin is out of power. Putin commented on this while in Vietnam:

Talks on Ukraine could take place as early as tomorrow, but Russia will use the current situation as a starting point, the president added.

 Putin Says West Prepared To Scapegoat Zelensky For War Failures: 'Replaced By Next Year'

Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Vietnam, where he signed at least a dozen energy and trade deals with the country's President To Lam, on his tour to shore up ties in Asia in an effort to offset the West's drive to isolate Moscow.

On his last day in the country he made some wide-ranging remarks to the press, and among the most interesting was a statement on the future of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Putin predicted at a moment things are going very badly for Ukrainian forces, and at a rare time Western media seems to be turning on Zelensky, that the Ukrainian leader will soon be replaced over his poor and unpopular decision-making. Putin suggested Washington is essentially going to make him a scapegoat.

""In the West, they simply do not want to replace him [Zelenskyy], the time is not right. I think it's obvious to anyone. They will blame all unpopular decisions on him, including lowering the [military] draft age, and that's it,"" Putin asserted, according to Russian media translation.

Dear President Trump!

My name is Faina Savenkova. I am a teenager living in Donbass. I am 15 years old, and I am a young writer and journalist. However, the Ukrainian government sees me just as one of many civilian targets in this war. In my short life, I have had to endure the horrors of war due to the weapons that Western countries supply to Ukraine. I know that there was recently an attempt on your life. I am very glad that the perpetrator did not succeed because human life is the greatest gift given to us by God. But the deadly threat that you face is the threat that the children of Donbass face every day at the hands of Ukraine’s extremist government.

July 27th is the Day of Remembrance for the Children Victims of the War in Donbass. On July 27, 2014, the Ukrainian military launched a massive artillery strike on Horlivka, resulting in the deaths of 22 civilians, including children. Yes, the war in Ukraine began in 2014. Since then, the aggression of the Ukrainian authorities and army towards the civilians of Donbass has only intensified, which is why we want to live in the safety Russian Federation. The list of deceased children is only growing, as they continue to die due to the ambitions of adults. This must be stopped as soon as possible.

In one of your speeches to American voters, you said that you want to make America great again. Mr. Trump, the greatness of a country depends not only on the amount of weaponry it supplies to other countries, such as Ukraine, but also on whether this country can stop supplying those weapons that kill innocents. President Biden started the war in Ukraine, and now every day, hundreds of Ukrainians die on the battlefield. You may not consider yourself a friend of Russia, but I am sure that you can help bring this conflict to a speedy end. I also hope that Russia and the United States can establish a dialogue for the sake of mankind's future and the entire planet.

EN_UA_DEV_213,"US and NATO escalation of conflict with Russia is leading to war 

 The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.

All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.

In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.

As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.

As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s “aluminum tubes” and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as “evidence” satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia, which supposedly show the movement of military materiel out of the country’s Far East in a westerly direction.

Further “proof” of an imminent Russian invasion are meaningless images of 1) tire tracks allegedly created in the snow by the weight of military vehicles being loaded for transport near Lake Baikal; 2) “Iskander-M launch vehicles covered in tarp at an unspecified location;” and 3) a train allegedly parked near a station in Primorskiy Krai “fully loaded with what appears to be military vehicles.” All of this amounts to nothing.

Turning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”

Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?

As for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.

The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”

The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.

Speaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”

These include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.

In this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”

This is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.

It writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.

The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.

Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.

The question that arises is why the United States, the principal instigator of the confrontation with Russia—and, it must be added, China—is pursuing an incredibly reckless policy that can lead only to disaster.

The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.

But the United States cannot “learn from its mistakes.” Thirty years after the first Bush administration proclaimed the “unipolar moment” and the start of a New American Century, the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.

The entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt, which has grown exponentially over the past 14 years, particularly since the bailout of Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash.

Fueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions.

The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.

The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis. “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.”

The American crisis is, however, not unique. It is the epicenter of a global crisis of the entire capitalist system.

Turning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”

Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?

As for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.

The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”

The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.

Speaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”

These include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.

In this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”

This is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.

It writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.

The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.

Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.

The question that arises is why the United States, the principal instigator of the confrontation with Russia—and, it must be added, China—is pursuing an incredibly reckless policy that can lead only to disaster.

The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.

But the United States cannot “learn from its mistakes.” Thirty years after the first Bush administration proclaimed the “unipolar moment” and the start of a New American Century, the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.

The entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt, which has grown exponentially over the past 14 years, particularly since the bailout of Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash.

Fueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions.

The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.

The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis. “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.”

The American crisis is, however, not unique. It is the epicenter of a global crisis of the entire capitalist system.

Turning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”

Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?

As for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.

The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”

The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.

Speaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”

These include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.

In this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”

This is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.

It writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.

The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.

Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.

The question that arises is why the United States, the principal instigator of the confrontation with Russia—and, it must be added, China—is pursuing an incredibly reckless policy that can lead only to disaster.

The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.

But the United States cannot “learn from its mistakes.” Thirty years after the first Bush administration proclaimed the “unipolar moment” and the start of a New American Century, the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.

The entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt, which has grown exponentially over the past 14 years, particularly since the bailout of Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash.

Fueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions.

The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.

The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis. “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.”

The American crisis is, however, not unique. It is the epicenter of a global crisis of the entire capitalist system.

The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.

In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.

As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.

As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s “aluminum tubes” and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as “evidence” satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia, which supposedly show the movement of military materiel out of the country’s Far East in a westerly direction.

Further “proof” of an imminent Russian invasion are meaningless images of 1) tire tracks allegedly created in the snow by the weight of military vehicles being loaded for transport near Lake Baikal; 2) “Iskander-M launch vehicles covered in tarp at an unspecified location;” and 3) a train allegedly parked near a station in Primorskiy Krai “fully loaded with what appears to be military vehicles.” All of this amounts to nothing.

Turning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”

Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?

As for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.

The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”

The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.

Speaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”

These include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.

In this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”

This is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.

It writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.

The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.

Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.

The question that arises is why the United States, the principal instigator of the confrontation with Russia—and, it must be added, China—is pursuing an incredibly reckless policy that can lead only to disaster.

The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.

But the United States cannot “learn from its mistakes.” Thirty years after the first Bush administration proclaimed the “unipolar moment” and the start of a New American Century, the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.

The entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt, which has grown exponentially over the past 14 years, particularly since the bailout of Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash.

Fueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions.

The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.

The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis. “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.”

The American crisis is, however, not unique. It is the epicenter of a global crisis of the entire capitalist system.

EN_UA_DEV_213,"US and NATO escalation of conflict with Russia is leading to war 

 The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.

All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.

In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.

As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.

As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s “aluminum tubes” and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as “evidence” satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia, which supposedly show the movement of military materiel out of the country’s Far East in a westerly direction.

Further “proof” of an imminent Russian invasion are meaningless images of 1) tire tracks allegedly created in the snow by the weight of military vehicles being loaded for transport near Lake Baikal; 2) “Iskander-M launch vehicles covered in tarp at an unspecified location;” and 3) a train allegedly parked near a station in Primorskiy Krai “fully loaded with what appears to be military vehicles.” All of this amounts to nothing.

Turning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”

Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?

As for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.

The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”

The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.

Speaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”

These include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.

In this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”

This is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.

It writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.

The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.

Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.

The question that arises is why the United States, the principal instigator of the confrontation with Russia—and, it must be added, China—is pursuing an incredibly reckless policy that can lead only to disaster.

The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.

But the United States cannot “learn from its mistakes.” Thirty years after the first Bush administration proclaimed the “unipolar moment” and the start of a New American Century, the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.

The entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt, which has grown exponentially over the past 14 years, particularly since the bailout of Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash.

Fueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions.

The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.

The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis. “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.”

The American crisis is, however, not unique. It is the epicenter of a global crisis of the entire capitalist system.

EN_UA_DEV_213,"US and NATO escalation of conflict with Russia is leading to war 

 The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.

All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.

In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.

As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.

As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s “aluminum tubes” and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as “evidence” satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia, which supposedly show the movement of military materiel out of the country’s Far East in a westerly direction.

Further “proof” of an imminent Russian invasion are meaningless images of 1) tire tracks allegedly created in the snow by the weight of military vehicles being loaded for transport near Lake Baikal; 2) “Iskander-M launch vehicles covered in tarp at an unspecified location;” and 3) a train allegedly parked near a station in Primorskiy Krai “fully loaded with what appears to be military vehicles.” All of this amounts to nothing.

Turning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”

Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?

As for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.

The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”

The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.

Speaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”

These include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.

In this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”

This is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.

It writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.

The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.

Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.

The question that arises is why the United States, the principal instigator of the confrontation with Russia—and, it must be added, China—is pursuing an incredibly reckless policy that can lead only to disaster.

The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.

But the United States cannot “learn from its mistakes.” Thirty years after the first Bush administration proclaimed the “unipolar moment” and the start of a New American Century, the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.

The entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt, which has grown exponentially over the past 14 years, particularly since the bailout of Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash.

Fueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions.

The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.

The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis. “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.”

 The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.

All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.

In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.

As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.

As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s “aluminum tubes” and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as “evidence” satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia, which supposedly show the movement of military materiel out of the country’s Far East in a westerly direction.

Further “proof” of an imminent Russian invasion are meaningless images of 1) tire tracks allegedly created in the snow by the weight of military vehicles being loaded for transport near Lake Baikal; 2) “Iskander-M launch vehicles covered in tarp at an unspecified location;” and 3) a train allegedly parked near a station in Primorskiy Krai “fully loaded with what appears to be military vehicles.” All of this amounts to nothing.

Turning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”

Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?

As for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.

The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”

The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.

Speaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”

These include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.

In this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”

This is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.

It writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.

The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.

Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.

The question that arises is why the United States, the principal instigator of the confrontation with Russia—and, it must be added, China—is pursuing an incredibly reckless policy that can lead only to disaster.

The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.

The question that arises is why the United States, the principal instigator of the confrontation with Russia—and, it must be added, China—is pursuing an incredibly reckless policy that can lead only to disaster.

The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.

But the United States cannot “learn from its mistakes.” Thirty years after the first Bush administration proclaimed the “unipolar moment” and the start of a New American Century, the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.

The entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt, which has grown exponentially over the past 14 years, particularly since the bailout of Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash.

Fueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions.

The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.

The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis. “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.”

The American crisis is, however, not unique. It is the epicenter of a global crisis of the entire capitalist system.

EN_UA_DEV_213,"US and NATO escalation of conflict with Russia is leading to war 

 The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.

All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.

In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.

As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.

As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s “aluminum tubes” and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as “evidence” satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia, which supposedly show the movement of military materiel out of the country’s Far East in a westerly direction.

Further “proof” of an imminent Russian invasion are meaningless images of 1) tire tracks allegedly created in the snow by the weight of military vehicles being loaded for transport near Lake Baikal; 2) “Iskander-M launch vehicles covered in tarp at an unspecified location;” and 3) a train allegedly parked near a station in Primorskiy Krai “fully loaded with what appears to be military vehicles.” All of this amounts to nothing.

Turning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”

Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?

As for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.

The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”

The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.

Speaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”

These include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.

In this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”

This is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.

It writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.

Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.

But the United States cannot “learn from its mistakes.” Thirty years after the first Bush administration proclaimed the “unipolar moment” and the start of a New American Century, the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.

The entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt, which has grown exponentially over the past 14 years, particularly since the bailout of Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash.

Fueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions.

The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.

The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis. “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.”

The American crisis is, however, not unique. It is the epicenter of a global crisis of the entire capitalist system.

EN_UA_DEV_213,"US and NATO escalation of conflict with Russia is leading to war 

 The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.

All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.

In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.

As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.

As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s “aluminum tubes” and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as “evidence” satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia, which supposedly show the movement of military materiel out of the country’s Far East in a westerly direction.

Further “proof” of an imminent Russian invasion are meaningless images of 1) tire tracks allegedly created in the snow by the weight of military vehicles being loaded for transport near Lake Baikal; 2) “Iskander-M launch vehicles covered in tarp at an unspecified location;” and 3) a train allegedly parked near a station in Primorskiy Krai “fully loaded with what appears to be military vehicles.” All of this amounts to nothing.

Turning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”

Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?

As for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.

The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”

The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.

Speaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”

These include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.

In this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”

This is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.

It writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.

The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.

Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.

From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.

But the United States cannot “learn from its mistakes.” Thirty years after the first Bush administration proclaimed the “unipolar moment” and the start of a New American Century, the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.

The entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt, which has grown exponentially over the past 14 years, particularly since the bailout of Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash.

Fueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions.

The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.

The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis. “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.”

The American crisis is, however, not unique. It is the epicenter of a global crisis of the entire capitalist system.

EN_UA_DEV_213,"US and NATO escalation of conflict with Russia is leading to war 

 The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.

All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.

In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.

As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.

As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s “aluminum tubes” and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as “evidence” satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia, which supposedly show the movement of military materiel out of the country’s Far East in a westerly direction.

Further “proof” of an imminent Russian invasion are meaningless images of 1) tire tracks allegedly created in the snow by the weight of military vehicles being loaded for transport near Lake Baikal; 2) “Iskander-M launch vehicles covered in tarp at an unspecified location;” and 3) a train allegedly parked near a station in Primorskiy Krai “fully loaded with what appears to be military vehicles.” All of this amounts to nothing.

Turning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”

Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?

As for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.

The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”

The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.

Speaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”

These include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.

In this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”

This is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.

It writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.

The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.

Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.

The question that arises is why the United States, the principal instigator of the confrontation with Russia—and, it must be added, China—is pursuing an incredibly reckless policy that can lead only to disaster.

The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended.

EN_UA_DEV_213,"US and NATO escalation of conflict with Russia is leading to war 

 The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.

All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.

In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.

As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.

As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s “aluminum tubes” and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as “evidence” satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia, which supposedly show the movement of military materiel out of the country’s Far East in a westerly direction.

Further “proof” of an imminent Russian invasion are meaningless images of 1) tire tracks allegedly created in the snow by the weight of military vehicles being loaded for transport near Lake Baikal; 2) “Iskander-M launch vehicles covered in tarp at an unspecified location;” and 3) a train allegedly parked near a station in Primorskiy Krai “fully loaded with what appears to be military vehicles.” All of this amounts to nothing.

Turning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”

Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?

As for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.

The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”

The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.

Speaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”

These include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.

In this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”

This is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.

It writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.

The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.

Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.

The question that arises is why the United States, the principal instigator of the confrontation with Russia—and, it must be added, China—is pursuing an incredibly reckless policy that can lead only to disaster.

The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.

But the United States cannot “learn from its mistakes.” Thirty years after the first Bush administration proclaimed the “unipolar moment” and the start of a New American Century, the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.

EN_UA_DEV_213,"US and NATO escalation of conflict with Russia is leading to war 

 The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.

All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.

In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.

As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.

As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s “aluminum tubes” and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as “evidence” satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia, which supposedly show the movement of military materiel out of the country’s Far East in a westerly direction.

Further “proof” of an imminent Russian invasion are meaningless images of 1) tire tracks allegedly created in the snow by the weight of military vehicles being loaded for transport near Lake Baikal; 2) “Iskander-M launch vehicles covered in tarp at an unspecified location;” and 3) a train allegedly parked near a station in Primorskiy Krai “fully loaded with what appears to be military vehicles.” All of this amounts to nothing.

Turning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”

Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?

As for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.

The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”

The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.

Speaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”

These include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.

In this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”

This is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.

It writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.

The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.

Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.

The question that arises is why the United States, the principal instigator of the confrontation with Russia—and, it must be added, China—is pursuing an incredibly reckless policy that can lead only to disaster.

The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.

But the United States cannot “learn from its mistakes.” Thirty years after the first Bush administration proclaimed the “unipolar moment” and the start of a New American Century, the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.

The entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt, which has grown exponentially over the past 14 years, particularly since the bailout of Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash.

Fueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions.

The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.

The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis. “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.”

EN_UA_DEV_213,"US and NATO escalation of conflict with Russia is leading to war 

 The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.

All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.

In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.

As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.

As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s “aluminum tubes” and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as “evidence” satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia, which supposedly show the movement of military materiel out of the country’s Far East in a westerly direction.

Further “proof” of an imminent Russian invasion are meaningless images of 1) tire tracks allegedly created in the snow by the weight of military vehicles being loaded for transport near Lake Baikal; 2) “Iskander-M launch vehicles covered in tarp at an unspecified location;” and 3) a train allegedly parked near a station in Primorskiy Krai “fully loaded with what appears to be military vehicles.” All of this amounts to nothing.

Turning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”

Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?

As for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.

The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”

The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.

Speaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”

These include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.

In this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”

This is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.

It writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.

The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.

Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.

The question that arises is why the United States, the principal instigator of the confrontation with Russia—and, it must be added, China—is pursuing an incredibly reckless policy that can lead only to disaster.

The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.

But the United States cannot “learn from its mistakes.” Thirty years after the first Bush administration proclaimed the “unipolar moment” and the start of a New American Century, the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.

The entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt, which has grown exponentially over the past 14 years, particularly since the bailout of Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash.

Fueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions.

The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.

The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis. “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.”

The American crisis is, however, not unique. It is the epicenter of a global crisis of the entire capitalist system.
